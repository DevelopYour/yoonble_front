    "faq": {
        "1": {
            "question": "How long does the treatment last?",
            "answer": "The longevity of semi-permanent procedures varies depending on skin type, lifestyle, and skin regeneration cycle. Typically, results last around 8 months to 1.5 years. As the color naturally fades, you can get a touch-up as needed."
        },
        "2": {
            "question": "Will it look natural immediately after the procedure?",
            "answer": "Immediately after the procedure, the color may appear darker, and there may be swelling or a peeling process. It generally looks natural within 7 to 10 days."
        },
        "3": {
            "question": "Is the procedure painful?",
            "answer": "Pain tolerance varies among individuals, but most people feel little to no pain. Some may experience a slight tingling or itching sensation, but it is generally bearable."
        },
        "4": {
            "question": "Can I wear makeup before my appointment? When can I wear makeup after the procedure?",
            "answer": "You can wear makeup when visiting, as we assist with cleansing the treatment area. (However, for eyelash perm treatments, eye makeup must be removed beforehand.) After the procedure, makeup can be applied the same day, avoiding the treated area."
        },
        "5": {
            "question": "Is a touch-up necessary after the procedure?",
            "answer": "A touch-up is optional, depending on personal preference. Since peeling varies for each individual, if you want a darker shade or need corrections after the first procedure, a touch-up is recommended."
        },
        "6": {
            "question": "Are there any cases where the procedure is not possible?",
            "answer": "Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals may not retain the pigment properly due to hormonal changes, and their skin may be more sensitive. Additionally, those who have had plastic surgery within the past six months should consult a doctor before scheduling an appointment."
        },
        "7": {
            "question": "Can I change the design or color of an existing semi-permanent procedure?",
            "answer": "This depends on the current condition of the previous procedure. Most cases can be corrected with a neutralization cover-up, but in some cases, removal and reapplication may be recommended."
